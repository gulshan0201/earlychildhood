                <h2>The Role of Engineering</h2>
                <p>Engineering helps children understand problem-solving, creativity, and logical thinking. It teaches them how to build, design, and create solutions to real-world problems. 
                    Through engineering, children develop a sense of curiosity and inquiry, learning how things work and how they can improve existing designs. Engineering principles also encourage children to think critically and analyze different possibilities before reaching a solution.
                    Engaging in hands-on engineering activities at an early age can help develop essential skills such as teamwork, patience, and perseverance. It also fosters a growth mindset, where children learn to view failures as opportunities for improvement.

                <h2>Why Engineering is Important?</h2>
                <p>Engineering builds confidence and encourages children to become problem solvers by allowing them to tackle real-world challenges creatively and logically. Through hands-on activities, children develop critical thinking skills, spatial reasoning, and the ability to analyze and troubleshoot problems. It also fosters teamwork, as many engineering projects require collaboration, communication, and the sharing of ideas. Additionally, engineering teaches perseverance by showing children that failure is a step toward success, encouraging them to experiment, adapt, and improve their designs.</p>
